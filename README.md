# Filter-Map-Reduce
Filter, Map, and Reduce

Filter: a function that filters out the odd numbers and keeps the even numbers in a vector (use std::copy_if) and returns a new vector that contains the results.

Map: a function that takes a vector of integers as input ​in​ and outputs a new vector out​ where out[i] = in[i] ^ 2 (Use std::transform)

Reduce: a function that sums up all elements in a vector (Use std::accumulate)
